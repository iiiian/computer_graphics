/********************************************

When we ray trace to more than one sphere,
we need to keep track of which sphere is
nearest to the viewpoint origin.

In other words -- which sphere intersects
the ray with the lowest value of t.

To make this easier to see, we can also shade
each sphere a different color.

You can also animate the spheres from within
the fragment shader, although this could be
very inefficient.
